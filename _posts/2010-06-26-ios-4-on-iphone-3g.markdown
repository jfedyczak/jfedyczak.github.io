I've installed iOS 4 update the minute it became available. It worked like shit since then. Today I started reading about downgrade procedure, but I've decided to give it another chance.

It works much snappier now. Here's what I've done:

- removed unused apps (BeejiveIM, fringe, Blue Skies, Black Mamba Racing, CardKing),
- changed push settings to manual in several of my IMAP mailboxes (four left in push mode),
- removed Notes syncing in all but one accounts,

After that things started to work much faster.

I'll keep you posted.

Update:

My final conclusion: iOS on 3G simply doesn't work. I'm virtually stuck in pre-iPhone times. Using this phone is just frustrating. Can't wait for iPhone 4.
