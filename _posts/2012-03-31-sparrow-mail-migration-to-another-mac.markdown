To migrate [Sparrow Mail](http://sparrowapp.com/) mail and settings to another Mac, do the following:

1. Copy content of `~/Library/Application Support/Sparrow` folder
2. Copy file `~/Library/Preferences/com.sparrowmailapp.sparrow.plist`

Remember to quit the app on both machines before transfering files. Above worked for version `1.5`.
